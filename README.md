# ambrosus-node-contracts
Smart contracts used in AMB-NET

## Development
Install dependencies and compile contracts:
```
yarn
yarn build
```

To run test RPC mock, with properly predefined accounts for development and testing:
```
yarn task ganache
```

Then deploy contracts and save outcome to an environment file
```
yarn task deploy --save <path to file>
```

You are ready to play.

The following administrative tasks are available: 
```
yarn task deploy
yarn task ganache
yarn task whitelist add [address]
yarn task whitelist remove [address]
yarn task whitelist check
yarn task stake deposit [role] [amount]
yarn task stake release
yarn task stake check
yarn task upload [bundleId] [storagePeriods]
yarn task transfer list
yarn task transfer start [bundleId]
yarn task transfer resolve [transferId]
yarn task transfer cancel [transferId]
```

## Testing
To install dependencies call:
```
yarn
```

To compile contracts:
```
yarn build
```

To run tests:
```
yarn test
```


Alternatively, to compile contracts and test:
```
